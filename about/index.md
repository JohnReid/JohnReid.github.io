## About me

I am a scientific researcher working at the Medical Research Council's
[Biostatistics
Unit](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/john-reid/)
at Cambridge University. I keep my full curriculum vitae relatively up-to-date at
[linkedin.com](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/john-reid-8956434).  Before working
in academia, I wrote software and consulted on middleware systems for financial
institutions worldwide.

## Personal

In case you hadn't guessed by now, I like mountains and ski-mountaineering.  I
also like to play chess (for Hackney Chess Club) which I do to a reasonable
standard; I do some (mainly indoor) rock-climbing to a low standard; I play
latin piano (only for my own amusement) and I play football. I live in North
London with my beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters.
