DeepMind's

may have all garnered all the
[headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/11/creative-alphazero-leads-way-chess-computers-science)
in the last few years as the best go, chess, and shogi playing entity on the
planet. Its playing strength is often attributed to its ability to learn
through self-play but this technique is not new, its use was pioneered by
Gerald Tesauro in the late 1980s and early 90s. Tesauro created
*[TD-Gammon](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.215)*,
a world-class backgammon AI that learned by self-play.

In 1993-94 I was introduced to neural networks whilst studying for
a postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge and
I wanted to learn more. Somehow, although I cannot remember how, I had heard of
Gerald Tesauro's revolutionary work and was interested in replicating his
results for my thesis. I was already playing backgammon in the university club
and at the pure maths department, so the project naturally combined two
interests.

The result was *Fatboy*, a backgammon playing agent taught entirely through
self-play. Fatboy included an interface to [FIBS](http://www.fibs.com/) and to
the best of my knowledge was the first AI agent to play online against
all-comers on the internet.

## Game-playing AIs

- Samuel's checkers programs.
- Moriarty's genetic algorithms for Othello.
- Schraudolph and other's go.
- Tesauro's TD-Gammon.
- Boyan's modular networks.


## Why backgammon?

- stochastic nature
- positional versus tactical


## Early 90s neural networks

- no TensorFlow or PyTorch
- back-propagation from scratch
- ANSI C


## Reinforcement learning

Reward signal


### Temporal difference learning
