    Regulation of transcription lies at the heart of many of the most critical
    cellular behaviours. This regulation is mediated by the binding of
    transcription factors to the

    genome. There is much uncertainty about many aspects of this process.
    Firstly, individual transcription factors preferentially bind to a variety
    of genomic sequences. Even

    when these preferences are known, predicting transcription factor binding
    sites has a high

    false positive rate. Secondly, the sequence preferences of many
    transcription factors are

    uncharacterised. Biological experiments only provide indirect evidence of
    transcription

    factor binding. The task of inferring the sequence preferences given these
    indirect data

    is difficult. Thirdly, transcription factors do not operate in isolation.
    Sets of interacting

    transcription factors are reused across distinct cellular programs. Many of
    these cellular programs and sets of transcription factors remain to be
    characterised. This thesis

    uses probabilistic modelling techniques to present three contributions that
    address the

    aforementioned uncertainty about transcriptional regulation.

    I describe a novel method that uses conservation of genomic sequences
    between related

    species to improve predictions of transcription factor binding. Unlike other
    similar

    methods, a multiple alignment of the regions of interest is not required.

    Some of the most popular and best methods for characterising the sequence
    binding

    preferences of transcription factors are not able to handle data sets of the
    size generated

    by recent biological techniques. I present a novel technique that uses
    suffix trees to

    speed up one of the most popular existing techniques so that it can be
    applied to much

    larger data sets.

    I present a hierarchical non-parametric probabilistic model that captures
    interactions

    between transcription factors and their target genes. This model infers
    several well

    established interactions between transcription factors in an unsupervised
    setting.

    Taken together these methods demonstrate how apposite probabilistic
    modelling techniques are for quantifying uncertainty in transcriptional
    regulation.
