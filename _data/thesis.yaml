  abstract: >-
    Regulation of transcription lies at the heart of many of the most critical
    cellular behaviours. This regulation is mediated by the binding of
    transcription factors to the genome. There is much uncertainty about many aspects of this process.
    Firstly, individual transcription factors preferentially bind to a variety of
    genomic sequences. Even when these preferences are known, predicting transcription factor binding
    sites has a high false positive rate. Secondly, the sequence preferences of many transcription
    factors are uncharacterised. Biological experiments only provide indirect evidence of
    transcription factor binding. The task of inferring the sequence preferences given these
    indirect data is difficult. Thirdly, transcription factors do not operate in isolation.
    Sets of interacting transcription factors are reused across distinct cellular programs. Many of
    these cellular programs and sets of transcription factors remain to be
    characterised. This thesis uses probabilistic modelling techniques to present three contributions that
    address the aforementioned uncertainty about transcriptional regulation.

    I describe a novel method that uses conservation of genomic sequences between
    related species to improve predictions of transcription factor binding. Unlike other
    similar methods, a multiple alignment of the regions of interest is not required.

    Some of the most popular and best methods for characterising the sequence
    binding preferences of transcription factors are not able to handle data sets of the
    size generated by recent biological techniques. I present a novel technique that uses suffix
    trees to speed up one of the most popular existing techniques so that it can be
    applied to much larger data sets.

    I present a hierarchical non-parametric probabilistic model that captures
    interactions between transcription factors and their target genes. This model infers
    several well established interactions between transcription factors in an unsupervised
    setting.

    Taken together these methods demonstrate how apposite probabilistic modelling
    techniques are for quantifying uncertainty in transcriptional regulation.
