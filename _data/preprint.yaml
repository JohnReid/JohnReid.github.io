  abstract: >-
    Mutual information-based network inference algorithms are an important tool
    in the reverse-engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, but all
    rely on estimates of the mutual information between the expression of pairs
    of genes. Various methods exist to compute estimates of the mutual
    information, but none have been firmly established as optimal for network
    inference. The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are
    compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and
    ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and
    two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of
    discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5
    estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are
    faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time
    up to a factor of 3,500. The B-spline estimator consistently performs well
    on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing
    inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is
    the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be
    robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters.
    Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using
    N 1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This
    contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.

    Nonparametric Bayesian inference of transcriptional branching and
    recombination identifies regulators of early human germ cell development
  container-title: bioRxiv
  page: '167684'

  abstract: >-
    During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate
    decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process; in
    some instances, these decisions may be reversible, particularly during the
    onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell
    transcriptomics provide a rich resource to explore the temporal progression
    of bifurcations in gene activity, and thus elucidate mechanisms of cell fate
    decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or
    recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a
    comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching
    and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes
    (B-RGPs). We use B-RGPs to infer transcriptional branching that occurs
    during early human development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), the
    precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using
    our approach, we identify known master regulators of human PGC development,
    and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways and genetic
    regulators. By concentrating on the earliest signalling events, we
    identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway
    in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate. Indeed, the
    experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological
    blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK) enhanced
    the competency for PGC fate in vitro. Thus, B-RGPs represent a powerful and
    flexible data driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell
    fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early
    embryogenesis.

    GPseudoRank: MCMC for sampling from posterior distributions of
    pseudo-orderings using Gaussian processes
  container-title: bioRxiv
  page: '211417'
  source: www.biorxiv.org
  abstract: >-
    A number of previous approaches to pseudotime estimation have provided point
    estimates of the ordering of cells for scRNA-seq data, while more recently,
    Gaussian process latent variable models and MCMC methods have been applied
    to understand the uncertainty associated with the pseudotemporal ordering.
    We present a new type of Gaussian process latent variable model for
    pseudotemporal ordering, which samples a distribution on the probability
    space of the orderings, that is on the group of permutations, rather than on
    the hugely high-dimensional vector space of possible pseudotimes, as done by
    previous models. We determine the best proposal distribution for our
    Metropolis-Hastings sampler for different types of data in an extensive
    simulation study, and show on a microarray data set that it is both able to
    capture complicated posterior distributions with modes close to pseudotime
    estimates found by state-of-the-art methods for point estimation of
    pseudotime orderings, and identify a global maximum of the distribution
    close to the true order. Finally, in an application to scRNA-seq data we
    demonstrate the particular potential of our method to identify phases of
    lower and higher pseudotime uncertainty during a biological process.

  abstract: >-
    The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short lived since
    tumors evolve and develop resistance. Combinations of drugs offer the
    potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible
    combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal
    treatments tailored to a patient's tumor. AstraZeneca carried out 11,576
    experiments on 910 drug combinations across 85 cancer cell lines,
    recapitulating in vivo response profiles. These data, the largest openly
    available screen, were hosted by DREAM alongside deep molecular
    characterization from the Sanger Institute for a Challenge to
    computationally predict synergistic drug pairs and associated biomarkers.
    160 teams participated to provide the most comprehensive methodological
    development and subsequent benchmarking to date. Winning methods
    incorporated prior knowledge of putative drug target interactions. For >60%
    of drug combinations synergy was reproducibly predicted with an accuracy
    matching biological replicate experiments, however 20% of drug combinations
    were poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy
    predictions were identified, including antagonism unique to combined
    PIK3CB/D inhibition with the ADAM17 inhibitor where synergy is seen with
    other PI3K pathway inhibitors. All data, methods and code are freely
    available as a resource to the community.

  title: Projection layers improve deep learning models of regulatory DNA function
  container-title: bioRxiv
  page: '412734'
  source: www.biorxiv.org
  abstract: >-
    With the increasing application of deep learning methods to the modelling of
    regulatory DNA sequences has come an interest in exploring what types of
    architecture are best suited to the domain. Networks designed to predict
    many functional characteristics of noncoding DNA in a multitask framework
    have to recognise a large number of motifs and as a result benefit from
    large numbers of convolutional filters in the first layer. The use of large
    first layers in turn motivates an exploration of strategies for addressing
    the sparsity of output and possibility for overfitting that result. To this
    end we propose the use of a dimensionality-reducing linear projection layer
    after the initial motif-recognising convolutions. In experiments with a
    reduced version of the DeepSEA dataset we find that inserting this layer in
    combination with dropout into convolutional and convolutional-recurrent
    architectures can improve predictive performance across a range of first
    layer sizes. We further validate our approach by incorporating the
    projection layer into a new convolutional-recurrent architecture which
    achieves state of the art performance on the full DeepSEA dataset. Analysis
    of the learned projection weights shows that the inclusion of this layer
    simplifies the network's internal representation of the occurrence of
    motifs, notably by projecting features representing forward and
    reverse-complement motifs to similar positions in the lower dimensional
    feature space output by the layer.

    Machine learning based classification of cells into chronological stages
    using single-cell transcriptomics.

  source: www.biorxiv.org
  abstract: >-
    Age-associated deterioration of cellular physiology leads to pathological
    conditions. The ability to detect premature aging could provide a window for
    preventive therapies against age-related diseases. However, the techniques
    for determining cellular age are limited, as they rely on a limited set of
    histological markers and lack predictive power. Here, we implement GERAS
    (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell), a machine learning based
    framework capable of assigning individual cells to chronological stages
    based on their transcriptomes. GERAS displays greater than 90% accuracy in
    classifying the chronological stage of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells.
    The framework demonstrates robustness against biological and technical
    noise, as evaluated by its performance on independent samplings of
    single-cells. Additionally, GERAS determines the impact of differences in
    calorie intake and BMI on the aging of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells,
    respectively. We further harness the predictive power of GERAS to identify
    genome-wide molecular factors that correlate with aging. We show that one of
    these factors, junb, is necessary to maintain the proliferative state of
    juvenile beta-cells. Our results showcase the applicability of a machine
    learning framework to classify the chronological stage of heterogeneous cell
    populations, while enabling to detect pro-aging factors and candidate genes
    associated with aging.
