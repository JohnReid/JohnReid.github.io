    Author summary Integrative clustering is the task of identifying groups of
    samples by combining information from several datasets. An example of this
    task is cancer subtyping, where we cluster tumour samples based on several
    datasets, such as gene expression, proteomics and others. Most existing
    algorithms assume that all such datasets share a similar cluster structure,
    with samples outside these clusters treated as noise. The structure can,
    however, be much more heterogeneous: some meaningful clusters may appear
    only in some datasets. In the paper, we introduce the Clusternomics
    algorithm that identifies groups of samples across heterogeneous datasets.
    It models both cluster structure of individual datasets, and the global
    structure that appears as a combination of local structures. The algorithm
    uses probabilistic modelling to identify the groups and share information
    across the local and global levels. We evaluated the algorithm on both
    simulated and real world datasets, where the algorithm found clinically
    significant clusters with different survival outcomes.

  abstract: >-
    Nodal, a secreted factor known for its conserved functions in cell-fate
    specification and the establishment of embryonic axes, is also required in
    mammals to maintain the pluripotency of the epiblast, the tissue that gives
    rise to all fetal lineages. Although Nodal is expressed as early as E3.5 in
    the mouse embryo, its regulation and functions at pre- and peri-implantation
    stages are currently unknown. Sensitive reporter transgenes for two Nodal
    cis-regulatory regions, the PEE and the ASE, exhibit specific expression
    profiles before implantation. Mutant and inhibitor studies find them
    respectively regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Activin/Nodal
    signaling, and provide evidence for localized and heterogeneous activities
    of these pathways in the inner cell mass, the epiblast and the primitive
    endoderm. These studies also show that Nodal and its prime effector, FoxH1,
    are not essential to preimplantation Activin/Nodal signaling. Finally, a
    strong upregulation of the ASE reporter in implanting blastocysts correlates
    with a downregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog in the maturing
    epiblast. This study uncovers conservation in the mouse blastocyst of
    Wnt/β-catenin and Activin/Nodal-dependent activities known to govern Nodal
    expression and the establishment of polarity in the blastula of other
    deuterostomes. Our results indicate that these pathways act early on to
    initiate distinct cell-specification processes in the ICM derivatives. Our
    data also suggest that the activity of the Activin/Nodal pathway is dampened
    by interactions with the molecular machinery of pluripotency until just
    before implantation, possibly delaying cell-fate decisions in the mouse
    embryo.

    Motif finding is a difficult problem that has been studied for over 20
    years. Some older popular motif finders are not suitable for analysis of the
    large data sets generated by next-generation sequencing. We recently
    published an efficient approximation (STEME) to the EM algorithm that is at
    the core of many motif finders such as MEME. This approximation allows the
    EM algorithm to be applied to large data sets. In this work we describe
    several efficient extensions to STEME that are based on the MEME algorithm.
    Together with the original STEME EM approximation, these extensions make
    STEME a fully-fledged motif finder with similar properties to MEME. We
    discuss the difficulty of objectively comparing motif finders. We show that
    STEME performs comparably to existing prominent discriminative motif
    finders, DREME and Trawler, on 13 sets of transcription factor binding data
    in mouse ES cells. We demonstrate the ability of STEME to find long
    degenerate motifs which these discriminative motif finders do not find. As
    part of our method, we extend an earlier method due to Nagarajan et al. for
    the efficient calculation of motif E-values. STEME's source code is
    available under an open source license and STEME is available via a web
    interface.

    Integrative analysis of high-throughput reporter assays, machine learning,
    and profiles of epigenomic chromatin state in a broad array of cells and
    tissues has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of
    non-coding regulatory element function and its contribution to human
    disease. Here we report results from the CAGI 5 regulation saturation
    challenge where participants were asked to predict the impact of nucleotide
    substitution at every base pair within five disease associated human
    enhancers and nine disease associated promoters. A library of mutations
    covering all bases was generated by saturation mutagenesis and altered
    activity was assessed in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in
    relevant cell lines. Reporter expression was measured relative to plasmid
    DNA to determine the impact of variants. The challenge was to predict the
    functional effects of variants on reporter expression. Comparative analysis
    of the full range of submitted prediction results identifies the most
    successful models of transcription factor binding sites, machine learning
    algorithms, and ways to choose among or incorporate diverse datatypes and
    cell-types for training computational models. These results have the
    potential to improve the design of future studies on more diverse sets of
    regulatory elements and aid the interpretation of disease associated genetic
    variation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

    Age-associated deterioration of cellular physiology leads to pathological
    conditions. The ability to detect premature aging could provide a window for
    preventive therapies against age-related diseases. However, the techniques
    for determining cellular age are limited, as they rely on a limited set of
    histological markers and lack predictive power. Here, we implement GERAS
    (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell), a machine learning based
    framework capable of assigning individual cells to chronological stages
    based on their transcriptomes. GERAS displays greater than 90% accuracy in
    classifying the chronological stage of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells.
    The framework demonstrates robustness against biological and technical
    noise, as evaluated by its performance on independent samplings of
    single-cells. Additionally, GERAS determines the impact of differences in
    calorie intake and BMI on the aging of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells,
    respectively. We further harness the predictive power of GERAS to identify
    genome-wide molecular factors that correlate with aging. We show that one of
    these factors, junb, is necessary to maintain the proliferative state of
    juvenile beta-cells. Our results showcase the applicability of a machine
    learning framework to classify the chronological stage of heterogeneous cell
    populations, while enabling to detect pro-aging factors and candidate genes
    associated with aging.

    An intricate link is becoming apparent between metabolism and cellular
    identities. Here, we explore the basis for such a link in an in vitro model
    for early mouse embryonic development: from naïve pluripotency to the
    specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs). Using single‐cell RNA‐seq
    with statistical modelling and modulation of energy metabolism, we
    demonstrate a functional role for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in
    naïve pluripotency. We link mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle activity
    to IDH2‐mediated production of alpha‐ketoglutarate and through it, the
    activity of key epigenetic regulators. Accordingly, this metabolite has a
    role in the maintenance of naïve pluripotency as well as in PGC
    differentiation, likely through preserving a particular histone methylation
    status underlying the transient state of developmental competence for the
    PGC fate. We reveal a link between energy metabolism and epigenetic control
    of cell state transitions during a developmental trajectory towards germ
    cell specification, and establish a paradigm for stabilizing fleeting
    cellular states through metabolic modulation.

    Investigations into the emerging link between metabolism and cellular
    identity during mouse early embryonic development reveals that the
    generation of alpha–ketoglutarate (αKG) by the mitochondrial TCA cycle
    enzyme IDH2 can modulate the epigenome, which, in turn, can maintain naïve
    pluripotency and prolong a transient competent state for primordial germ
    cell (PGC) specification.


    IDH2‐mediated production of αKG in the mitochondrial Krebs cycle promotes
    and maintains the epigenetic state of naïve pluripotent stem cells.αKG
    extends the transient state of developmental competence for the PGC fate.αKG
    supports the specification of mouse PGCs.Stabilisation of transient
    developmental states can occur through modulation of metabolic states of

  abstract: >-
    The process of transcription is highly stochastic leading to cell-to-cell
    variations and noise in gene expression levels. However, key essential genes
    have to be precisely expressed at the correct amount and time to ensure
    proper cellular development and function. Studies in yeast and bacterial
    systems have shown that gene expression noise decreases as mean expression
    levels increase, a relationship that is controlled by promoter DNA sequence.
    However, the function of distal cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), an
    evolutionary novelty of metazoans, in controlling transcriptional robustness
    and variability is poorly understood. In this study, we used live cell
    imaging of transfected reporters combined with a mathematical modelling and
    statistical inference scheme, to quantify the function of conserved Msx1
    CRMs and promoters in modulating single cell real time transcription rates
    in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. The results show that the mean expression-noise
    relationship is solely promoter controlled for this key pluripotency
    regulator. In addition, we demonstrate that CRMs modulate single cell basal
    promoter rate distributions in a graded manner across a population of cells.
    This extends the rheostatic model of CRM action to provide a more detailed
    understanding of CRM function at single cell resolution. We also identify a
    novel CRM transcriptional filter function that acts to reduce intracellular
    variability in transcription rates and show that this can be
    phylogenetically separable from rate modulating CRM activities. These
    results are important for understanding how the expression of key vertebrate
    developmental transcription factors is precisely controlled both within and
    between individual cells.
