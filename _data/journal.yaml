  abstract: >-
    Motif finding is a difficult problem that has been studied for over 20
    years. Some older popular motif finders are not suitable for analysis of the
    large data sets generated by next-generation sequencing. We recently
    published an efficient approximation (STEME) to the EM algorithm that is at
    the core of many motif finders such as MEME. This approximation allows the
    EM algorithm to be applied to large data sets. In this work we describe
    several efficient extensions to STEME that are based on the MEME algorithm.
    Together with the original STEME EM approximation, these extensions make
    STEME a fully-fledged motif finder with similar properties to MEME. We
    discuss the difficulty of objectively comparing motif finders. We show that
    STEME performs comparably to existing prominent discriminative motif
    finders, DREME and Trawler, on 13 sets of transcription factor binding data
    in mouse ES cells. We demonstrate the ability of STEME to find long
    degenerate motifs which these discriminative motif finders do not find. As
    part of our method, we extend an earlier method due to Nagarajan et al. for
    the efficient calculation of motif E-values. STEME's source code is
    available under an open source license and STEME is available via a web
    interface.

    Nodal cis-regulatory elements reveal epiblast and primitive endoderm
    heterogeneity in the peri-implantation mouse embryo
  container-title: Developmental Biology

  abstract: >-
    Nodal, a secreted factor known for its conserved functions in cell-fate
    specification and the establishment of embryonic axes, is also required in
    mammals to maintain the pluripotency of the epiblast, the tissue that gives
    rise to all fetal lineages. Although Nodal is expressed as early as E3.5 in
    the mouse embryo, its regulation and functions at pre- and peri-implantation
    stages are currently unknown. Sensitive reporter transgenes for two Nodal
    cis-regulatory regions, the PEE and the ASE, exhibit specific expression
    profiles before implantation. Mutant and inhibitor studies find them
    respectively regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Activin/Nodal
    signaling, and provide evidence for localized and heterogeneous activities
    of these pathways in the inner cell mass, the epiblast and the primitive
    endoderm. These studies also show that Nodal and its prime effector, FoxH1,
    are not essential to preimplantation Activin/Nodal signaling. Finally, a
    strong upregulation of the ASE reporter in implanting blastocysts correlates
    with a downregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog in the maturing
    epiblast. This study uncovers conservation in the mouse blastocyst of
    Wnt/β-catenin and Activin/Nodal-dependent activities known to govern Nodal
    expression and the establishment of polarity in the blastula of other
    deuterostomes. Our results indicate that these pathways act early on to
    initiate distinct cell-specification processes in the ICM derivatives. Our
    data also suggest that the activity of the Activin/Nodal pathway is dampened
    by interactions with the molecular machinery of pluripotency until just
    before implantation, possibly delaying cell-fate decisions in the mouse
    embryo.

    Conserved cis-regulatory modules control robustness in Msx1 expression at

  abstract: >-
    The process of transcription is highly stochastic leading to cell-to-cell
    variations and noise in gene expression levels. However, key essential genes
    have to be precisely expressed at the correct amount and time to ensure
    proper cellular development and function. Studies in yeast and bacterial
    systems have shown that gene expression noise decreases as mean expression
    levels increase, a relationship that is controlled by promoter DNA sequence.
    However, the function of distal cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), an
    evolutionary novelty of metazoans, in controlling transcriptional robustness
    and variability is poorly understood. In this study, we used live cell
    imaging of transfected reporters combined with a mathematical modelling and
    statistical inference scheme, to quantify the function of conserved Msx1
    CRMs and promoters in modulating single cell real time transcription rates
    in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. The results show that the mean expression-noise
    relationship is solely promoter controlled for this key pluripotency
    regulator. In addition, we demonstrate that CRMs modulate single cell basal
    promoter rate distributions in a graded manner across a population of cells.
    This extends the rheostatic model of CRM action to provide a more detailed
    understanding of CRM function at single cell resolution. We also identify a
    novel CRM transcriptional filter function that acts to reduce intracellular
    variability in transcription rates and show that this can be
    phylogenetically separable from rate modulating CRM activities. These
    results are important for understanding how the expression of key vertebrate
    developmental transcription factors is precisely controlled both within and
    between individual cells.

  abstract: >-
    Author summary Integrative clustering is the task of identifying groups of
    samples by combining information from several datasets. An example of this
    task is cancer subtyping, where we cluster tumour samples based on several
    datasets, such as gene expression, proteomics and others. Most existing
    algorithms assume that all such datasets share a similar cluster structure,
    with samples outside these clusters treated as noise. The structure can,
    however, be much more heterogeneous: some meaningful clusters may appear
    only in some datasets. In the paper, we introduce the Clusternomics
    algorithm that identifies groups of samples across heterogeneous datasets.
    It models both cluster structure of individual datasets, and the global
    structure that appears as a combination of local structures. The algorithm
    uses probabilistic modelling to identify the groups and share information
    across the local and global levels. We evaluated the algorithm on both
    simulated and real world datasets, where the algorithm found clinically
    significant clusters with different survival outcomes.
