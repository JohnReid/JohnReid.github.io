  abstract: >-
    With the increasing application of deep learning methods to the modelling of
    regulatory DNA sequences has come an interest in exploring what types of
    architecture are best suited to the domain. Networks designed to predict
    many functional characteristics of noncoding DNA in a multitask framework
    have to recognise a large number of motifs and as a result benefit from
    large numbers of convolutional filters in the first layer. The use of large
    first layers in turn motivates an exploration of strategies for addressing
    the sparsity of output and possibility for overfitting that result. To this
    end we propose the use of a dimensionality-reducing linear projection layer
    after the initial motif-recognising convolutions. In experiments with a
    reduced version of the DeepSEA dataset we find that inserting this layer in
    combination with dropout into convolutional and convolutional-recurrent
    architectures can improve predictive performance across a range of first
    layer sizes. We further validate our approach by incorporating the
    projection layer into a new convolutional-recurrent architecture which
    achieves state of the art performance on the full DeepSEA dataset. Analysis
    of the learned projection weights shows that the inclusion of this layer
    simplifies the network's internal representation of the occurrence of
    motifs, notably by projecting features representing forward and
    reverse-complement motifs to similar positions in the lower dimensional
    feature space output by the layer.

    Nonparametric Bayesian inference of transcriptional branching and
    recombination identifies regulators of early human germ cell development

  abstract: >-
    During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate
    decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process; in
    some instances, these decisions may be reversible, particularly during the
    onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell
    transcriptomics provide a rich resource to explore the temporal progression
    of bifurcations in gene activity, and thus elucidate mechanisms of cell fate
    decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or
    recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a
    comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching
    and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes
    (B-RGPs). We use B-RGPs to infer transcriptional branching that occurs
    during early human development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), the
    precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using
    our approach, we identify known master regulators of human PGC development,
    and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways and genetic
    regulators. By concentrating on the earliest signalling events, we
    identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway
    in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate. Indeed, the
    experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological
    blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK) enhanced
    the competency for PGC fate in vitro. Thus, B-RGPs represent a powerful and
    flexible data driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell
    fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early
    embryogenesis.

    Mutual Information Estimation For Transcriptional Regulatory Network
    Inference

  abstract: >-
    Mutual information-based network inference algorithms are an important tool
    in the reverse-engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, but all
    rely on estimates of the mutual information between the expression of pairs
    of genes. Various methods exist to compute estimates of the mutual
    information, but none have been firmly established as optimal for network
    inference. The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are
    compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and
    ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and
    two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of
    discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5
    estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are
    faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time
    up to a factor of 3,500. The B-spline estimator consistently performs well
    on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing
    inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is
    the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be
    robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters.
    Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using
    N 1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This
    contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.
