  abstract: >-
    Mutual information-based network inference algorithms are an important tool
    in the reverse-engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, but all
    rely on estimates of the mutual information between the expression of pairs
    of genes. Various methods exist to compute estimates of the mutual
    information, but none have been firmly established as optimal for network
    inference. The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are
    compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and
    ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and
    two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of
    discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5
    estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are
    faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time
    up to a factor of 3,500. The B-spline estimator consistently performs well
    on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing
    inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is
    the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be
    robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters.
    Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using
    N 1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This
    contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.

    Nonparametric Bayesian inference of transcriptional branching and
    recombination identifies regulators of early human germ cell development
  container-title: bioRxiv

  abstract: >-
    During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate
    decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process; in
    some instances, these decisions may be reversible, particularly during the
    onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell
    transcriptomics provide a rich resource to explore the temporal progression
    of bifurcations in gene activity, and thus elucidate mechanisms of cell fate
    decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or
    recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a
    comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching
    and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes
    (B-RGPs). We use B-RGPs to infer transcriptional branching that occurs
    during early human development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), the
    precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using
    our approach, we identify known master regulators of human PGC development,
    and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways and genetic
    regulators. By concentrating on the earliest signalling events, we
    identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway
    in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate. Indeed, the
    experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological
    blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK) enhanced
    the competency for PGC fate in vitro. Thus, B-RGPs represent a powerful and
    flexible data driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell
    fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early
    embryogenesis.

  abstract: >-
    The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short lived since
    tumors evolve and develop resistance. Combinations of drugs offer the
    potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible
    combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal
    treatments tailored to a patient's tumor. AstraZeneca carried out 11,576
    experiments on 910 drug combinations across 85 cancer cell lines,
    recapitulating in vivo response profiles. These data, the largest openly
    available screen, were hosted by DREAM alongside deep molecular
    characterization from the Sanger Institute for a Challenge to
    computationally predict synergistic drug pairs and associated biomarkers.
    160 teams participated to provide the most comprehensive methodological
    development and subsequent benchmarking to date. Winning methods
    incorporated prior knowledge of putative drug target interactions. For >60%
    of drug combinations synergy was reproducibly predicted with an accuracy
    matching biological replicate experiments, however 20% of drug combinations
    were poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy
    predictions were identified, including antagonism unique to combined
    PIK3CB/D inhibition with the ADAM17 inhibitor where synergy is seen with
    other PI3K pathway inhibitors. All data, methods and code are freely
    available as a resource to the community.

  title: Projection layers improve deep learning models of regulatory DNA function
  container-title: bioRxiv

  source: www.biorxiv.org
  abstract: >-
    With the increasing application of deep learning methods to the modelling of
    regulatory DNA sequences has come an interest in exploring what types of
    architecture are best suited to the domain. Networks designed to predict
    many functional characteristics of noncoding DNA in a multitask framework
    have to recognise a large number of motifs and as a result benefit from
    large numbers of convolutional filters in the first layer. The use of large
    first layers in turn motivates an exploration of strategies for addressing
    the sparsity of output and possibility for overfitting that result. To this
    end we propose the use of a dimensionality-reducing linear projection layer
    after the initial motif-recognising convolutions. In experiments with a
    reduced version of the DeepSEA dataset we find that inserting this layer in
    combination with dropout into convolutional and convolutional-recurrent
    architectures can improve predictive performance across a range of first
    layer sizes. We further validate our approach by incorporating the
    projection layer into a new convolutional-recurrent architecture which
    achieves state of the art performance on the full DeepSEA dataset. Analysis
    of the learned projection weights shows that the inclusion of this layer
    simplifies the network's internal representation of the occurrence of
    motifs, notably by projecting features representing forward and
    reverse-complement motifs to similar positions in the lower dimensional
    feature space output by the layer.

    GPseudoClust: deconvolution of shared pseudo-trajectories at single-cell
    resolution
  container-title: bioRxiv
  page: '567115'
  source: www.biorxiv.org
  abstract: >-
    <p>Motivation: A large number of methods have been developed to cluster
    genes on the basis of their changes in mRNA expression over time, using bulk
    RNA-seq or microarray data. These methods cannot be directly applied to
    single-cell data, since the temporal order of the cells is unknown. One way
    to address this challenge is to first use pseudotime methods to order the
    cells, and then apply standard clustering techniques. However, pseudotime
    estimates are subject to high levels of uncer- tainty, and failing to
    account for this uncertainty is liable to lead to erroneous and/or
    over-confident gene clusters. Results: The proposed method, GPseudoClust, is
    a novel approach that both clusters genes for pseudotemporally ordered data
    and quantifies the uncertainty in cluster allocations arising from the
    uncertainty in the pseudotime ordering. GPseudoClust combines a recent
    method for pseudo- time inference with nonparametric Bayesian clustering
    methods, efficient MCMC sampling, and novel subsampling strategies. For
    branching data, GPseudoClust identifies differences in dynamic patterns for
    different branches. In an application to stimulated dendritic cells, we show
    that it categorises genes in a way consistent with known biological
    function. Furthermore, it integrates data from different cell lines, batches
    or experimental protocols in a principled way. Availability: An
    implementation is available on GitHub:

  title: 'SCRAM: Spatially Coherent Randomized Attention Maps'
  container-title: 'arXiv:1905.10308 [cs, stat]'
  source: arXiv.org
  abstract: >-
    Attention mechanisms and non-local mean operations in general are key
    ingredients in many state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In
    particular, the Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has
    recently achieved great success in natural language processing and computer
    vision. However, the vanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image
    with n pixels has O(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and
    sometimes prohibitively expensive for large-scale image data. In this paper,
    we propose a fast randomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n
    log(n)) time to produce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration
    is attributed to our insight that attention maps on real-world images
    usually exhibit (1) spatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central
    idea of SCRAM is to employ PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence
    algorithm, to quickly pinpoint the most compatible key (argmax) for each
    query first, and then exploit that knowledge to design a sparse
    approximation to non-local mean operations. Using the argmax (mode) to
    dynamically construct the sparse approximation distinguishes our algorithm
    from all of the existing sparse approximate methods and makes it very
    efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable approximation to any
    non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse approximations that
    can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary experimental results
    suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or scaling up the
    computation of attention maps in the Transformer.
