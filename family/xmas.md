  Some ideas [here](https://rareteacompany.com/collections/gifts/)

Please **check** with Kathryn before buying anything, she will know if anything
is already taken. She also has some already purchased items in her "shop". She
may be able to sell them on to you.

I have quite a few books and CDs listed on my [Amazon
wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/3KJ730RC96SMO?ref_=wl_share),
I would like these things but I find them less exciting than other presents.
Still if you find something that tickles your fancy on there, please buy it for
me! Some of them are out of print and therefore the prices are a bit
extortionate at the moment so feel free to ignore those. Also, Joel runs
a [great site](https://www.ethicalbooksearch.com/uk) that helps people find
ethical book sellers and avoid Amazon so please use that to find alternative
and sometimes cheaper sellers.

I may update this page so please check back if it helps.
