This is the story of *Fatboy*, a neural network that taught itself to play
backgammon back in the early 90s. When it connected to the [First Internet
Backgammon Server](http://www.fibs.com/) (FIBS) 24 hours a day and 7 days
a week in the summer of 94, it was probably the first autonomous AI game
playing agent on the internet. It wasn't the strongest backgammon playing
network, that title was taken by TD-Gammon and later by JellyFish, but for
a while it was the strongest freely available program. It played at a decent
level and generated a lot of
[interest](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.games.backgammon/fatboy|sort:date/rec.games.backgammon/U7uYIu3wk6Q/htGTNKMWz5AJ)
on FIBS when it first appeared.

DeepMind's
[AlphaZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go)
may have attracted all the
[headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/11/creative-alphazero-leads-way-chess-computers-science)
in the last few years as the best Go, chess, and shogi playing entity on the
planet. Its playing strength is often attributed to its ability to learn
through self-play but this technique is not new - its use was pioneered by
Gerald Tesauro in the late 80s and early 90s. Tesauro created
*[TD-Gammon](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.215)*,
a world-class backgammon AI that learned by self-play.

In 1993-94 I was introduced to neural networks while studying for
a postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge and
I wanted to learn more. Somehow, although I cannot remember how, I had heard of
Gerald Tesauro's revolutionary work and was interested in replicating his
results for my thesis. I was already playing backgammon for the Cambridge
University Backgammon Club and socially at the Department of Pure Mathematics
and Mathematical Statistics, so the project naturally combined two interests.

The result was *Fatboy*, a backgammon playing agent taught entirely through
self-play. Fatboy included an interface to FIBS and to the best of my knowledge
was the first AI agent to play online against all-comers on the internet.

## Game-playing AIs

Game playing is a natural environment to research and develop AI and has been
used as such since Samuel's
[checker](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392560)
[programs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5391906) in the 50s.
Some other notable early examples include:

  - [Hans Berliner's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Berliner) (the
    well-known computer chess programmer and correspondence chess world
    champion) rules-based [backgammon
    program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004370280900417)
    that in 1979 defeated the world champion of that time.
  - Tesauro's world class backgammon neural network agent
    [TD-Gammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon) (1989)
  - Boyan's [modular
    networks](https://bkgm.com/articles/Grater/Bibliography/files/Boyan-BackgammonThesis.pdf)
    for playing backgammon (1992)
  - Schraudolph, Dayan and Sejnowski's 9x9 [Go playing neural network
    agent](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/sds94.html) (1994)
  - Moriarty and Miikkulainen's [genetic
    algorithms](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/moriarty.discovering.pdf)
    for Othello (1995)


## Why backgammon?

Out of all these early game-playing AIs why was it that the most success was
found in backgammon with TD-Gammon? Many of these agents shared the same
learning algorithm and used similar neural architectures. The consensus is that
it was the nature of the game of backgammon that enabled TD-Gammon to perform
so well. The dice in backgammon are stochastic and this precludes long-term
planning. Calculating tactical skirmishes is less important than in games such
as chess. The evaluation of most chess positions (especially those critical to
the outcome of the game) relies heavily on deep tree search to resolve these
tactics. In contrast, the evaluation of backgammon positions depends more on
the recognition of positional features and an understanding of how they
interact rather than resolving a tree of variations.

In addition to the effect the dice have on the principles of evaluating
backgammon positions, they may also aid the learning algorithm. Reinforcement
learning algorithms for game playing can get stuck in local strategic minima
when they believe their sub-optimal strategies are best. However, a bad roll
can force the agent to visit positions it would not ordinarily choose. This
exploration can be vital for successful learning when it results in the
re-evaluation of positions previously thought to be bad. Indeed, the importance
of exploration for reinforcement learning is demonstrated by how much active
research is dedicated to exploration/exploitation trade-offs.


## Reinforcement learning

The field of [Reinforcement
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is concerned
with how to optimise an agent's behaviour to maximise some reward signal. The
reward signal is typically sparse in board games as the agent only receives
feedback when the game finishes.

Most game playing AI agents' behaviour relies on value functions. A value
function is a proxy for how good it is to be in any possible position in the
game. For example a value function that accurately estimates expected future
rewards would allow an agent to select optimal moves by considering the value
of each possible resulting position. Of course in practice 100% accurate estimates
are infeasible and much research effort is dedicated to how to learn value
functions.


### Temporal difference learning

Temporal difference algorithms learn a value function by bootstrapping. Given
an existing value function, $V$, they use evaluations of future states,
$V(x_{t+k})$, to update the evaluation of the current state, $V(x_t) \mapsto V^*(x_t)$.
TD-Lambda is one such algorithm that smooths evaluations using exponential
discounting.

$$
  V^*(x_t) = \frac{1}{n-t} \sum_{k=t+1}^n[(1 - \lambda^{k-t-1})V(x_t) + \lambda^{k-t-1}V(x_{t+k})]
$$

$\lambda$ is the discounting parameter, $x_n$ is the end of game state and
$V(x_n)$ is the reward signal.


## Fatboy

In Fatboy, $V$ is implemented as a neural network, the states $\{x_1, \dots,
x_n\}$ are generated by self-play with random dice and $V(x_t)$ is trained to
approximate $V^*(x_t)$ for all $t$. This procedure is repeated over many
thousands of games.

### Early 90s neural networks

In the early 90s there were no deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or
PyTorch. Fatboy was implemented from scratch in ANSI C. Modern optimisers like
ADAM were not available, although I did have to make a choice between back
propagation (with momentum), (scaled) conjugate gradient descent,
delta-bar-delta, and RProp.

<!-- ![Fatboy's forward propagation algorithm]({{ site.url }}/images/fatboy-forward-ii.jpg){: .center-image width="400px" } -->

The final Fatboy agent consisted of:

  - a set of hand-crafted position features (à la TD-Gammon)
  - a neural network with three hidden layers
  - outputs that represent the probability that a single or double game would
    be won or lost (backgammons were ignored as they were so rare and could
    almost always be avoided by a roll-off database)
  - an almost perfect database for bearing off
  - an understanding of backgammon match equity in relation to cube decisions

As described above the TD-Lambda reinforcement learning was used to update
the position evaluations arrived at through self-play.

Unfortunately, despite purchasing a USB floppy disk drive and trawling through
some antiquated disks, Fatboy's source code and weights have been lost and he
will probably never play backgammon again. This is probably for the best as he
might embarrass himself against the modern neural network backgammon playing
monsters.


## Online backgammon

Playing 24-by-7 had some advantages and Fatboy soon became the most active
player on FIBS. By November 1995 he had played over [36,000
games](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.backgammon/C8KL6uF9vuU).

There was some [discussion](https://bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+181) of his
playing strength. Several in the community were convinced he was over-rated but
this wasn't necessarily supported by the evidence. He played many more games
than human players which reduced the variance of his rating. In addition he had
virtually no defences against individuals who would not complete matches they
were about to lose, which had a negative effect on his rating. He definitely had
deficiencies in certain technical aspects of backgammon. This may have lead observers
to believe he was over-rated. However it could be that his positional play more than
made up for this. Indeed TD-Gammon and other neural network based agents forced
a re-evaluation of positional play in backgammon as they convinced the world
that some of their strategies were superior to those followed by world-class players.

In any case, Fatboy was rated well over the median rating and was getting into
expert territory. He was never close to challenging TD-Gammon for the title of
strongest backgammon playing bot and soon other neural network bots also
overtook him (for example mloner, Jellyfish and Snowie). However for a while he
was the strongest freely available bot.

Fatboy was popular with at least some of the FIBS
[community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.games.backgammon/fatboy|sort:date/rec.games.backgammon/S4T7wmYE5Bs/BJKMz9lc8k0J):

This is presumably the same [Darse
Billings](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/) who went on to research poker
playing AI. Anyway thanks for the quote Darse!
